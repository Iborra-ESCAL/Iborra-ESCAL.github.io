This repository is about the subject PROT3D.
The overall objective of this repository is to learn about the different production phases and technologies involved in the 3D design and prototyping process.

The aim is to share knowledge about the design of functional or industrial objects for reproduction in ceramic materials, and to develop prototypes and adapt them to processes that enable their serialisation or large-scale industrial production.

Basic knowledge of computer programmes, image processing, vector drawing and basic 3D object modelling is recommended.
